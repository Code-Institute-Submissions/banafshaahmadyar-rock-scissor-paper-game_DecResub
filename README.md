       **What Is Rock Paper Scissors?**
       
You may have played rock paper scissors before. 

Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first choice of players for a team.

If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players.

Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist

a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended).

The rules are straightforward:

   - Rock smashes scissors.
   - Paper covers rock.
   - Scissors cut paper.

   ## How it works
   ---
   The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors.
   The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward;
   and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player.
   Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.
   If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
