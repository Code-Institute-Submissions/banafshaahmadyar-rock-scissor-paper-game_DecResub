       **What Is Rock Paper Scissors?**
       
You may have played rock paper scissors before. 

Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first choice of players for a team.

If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players.

Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist

a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended).

The rules are straightforward:

   - Rock smashes scissors.
   - Paper covers rock.
   - Scissors cut paper.

## Testing
     I have manually tested my application by running it on the command prompt. inserting a value and see the result.
     I tested my python code on pep8online.com website, fixed some issues and below is the result after.
